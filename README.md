# kkafplay

A Python-based audio file player with quirky features that you may never need.

Despite its insignificance, it mainly serves as a minimal Python application template that my other Python projects could copy from.

The template includes the following

- Project file/folder layout
- PEP8 compliant source code
- Automated tests
- User documentation and doc-generation pipeline
- Dependency management setup
- Continuous integration pipeline, including cross-platform distribution

Application end-users should be able to take the binary installer and use as is. 
Developers should be able to build the app all the way to the binary installer.
